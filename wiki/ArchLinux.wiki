Installing packages from the AUR is a relatively simple process. Essentially:

	Acquire the tarball which contains the PKGBUILD and possibly other
	required files, like systemd-units and patches (but often not the
	actual code).  Extract the tarball (preferably in a folder set
	aside just for builds from the AUR) with

		tar -xzf foo.tar.gz

	Run makepkg in the directory where the files are saved

        obs: you must download PKGBUILD
		makepkg -s

	the code above will automatically resolve dependencies with pacman). This will
	download the code, compile it and pack it.  Look for a README file
	in src/, as it might contain information needed later on.  Install
	the resulting package with pacman:

    # pacman -U /path/to/pkg.tar.xz
